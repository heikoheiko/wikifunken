"""This is a recursive web crawler.  Don't go pointing this at random sites;
it doesn't respect robots.txt and it is pretty brutal about how quickly it
fetches pages.

The code for this is very short; this is perhaps a good indication
that this is making the most effective use of the primitves at hand.
The fetch function does all the work of making http requests,
searching for new urls, and dispatching new fetches.  The GreenPool
acts as sort of a job coordinator (and concurrency controller of
course).
