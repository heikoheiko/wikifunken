wikifunken - OpenWRT Wikipedia Offline Server
=============================================

This projects provides software to serve Wikipedia from a cheap OpenWRT powered router (like the TP-Link TL-WR703N).

Could be used to set up a $25 hotspot and serve Wikipedia in rural areas. 


It provides tools to:
 * score and select a subset of wikipedia articles 
 * fetch the articles
 * parse & rewrite artciles 
 * fetch the images
 * index the articles
 * pack the data in a SquashFS (read only compressed) filesystem
 * info on the OpenWRT configuration

Note: I hacked this since the Kiwix http server used to much resources to run on small hardware. The system basically worked and was tested with 50K articles. The whole thing is undocumented. Contact me if you are interested in using it and need help to get started.
